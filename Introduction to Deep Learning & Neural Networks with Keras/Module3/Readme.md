### Regression with Keras

* Python files: Regression_Keras.py
* Date file: concrete_data.csv
* The dataset is about the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them. 
* Data ingredients: Cement, Blast Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate
* Output file: DL_Reg_Keras.txt

### Classification with Keras

* Python files: Classification_with_Keras.py
* Date file: MNIST dataset from keras
* The MNIST database, short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
* The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau.
* Output file: DL_Class_Keras.txt
