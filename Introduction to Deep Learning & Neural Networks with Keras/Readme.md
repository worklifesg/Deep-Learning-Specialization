# Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
* Module 1 introduces the concept of deep learning along with neural networks fundamentals and how neural networks (NN) feed data forward throught the network.
Basically, it covers Forward Propagation technique through which the data is passed  via number of layers of neurons in NN from the input layers (Dendrites) to the output Layer.
* Module 2 consisits of deep learning concepts that are given in 'Notes_Concepts.d' file and basic backpropagation example where it's python code and results file in stored in Module 1.
* Module 3 consists of Regression and Classification models with Keras

### Regression with Keras

* Python files: Regression_Keras.py
* Date file: concrete_data.csv
* The dataset is about the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them. 
* Data ingredients: Cement, Blast Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate
* Output file: DL_Reg_Keras.txt
