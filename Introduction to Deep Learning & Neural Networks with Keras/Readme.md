# Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
* Module 1 introduces the concept of deep learning along with neural networks fundamentals and how neural networks (NN) feed data forward throught the network.
Basically, it covers Forward Propagation technique through which the data is passed  via number of layers of neurons in NN from the input layers (Dendrites) to the output Layer.
* Module 2 consisits of deep learning concepts that are given in 'Notes_Concepts.d' file and basic backpropagation example where it's python code and results file in stored in Module 1.
