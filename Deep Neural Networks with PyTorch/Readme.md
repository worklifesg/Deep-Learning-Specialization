# Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch

* Module 1 introduces the concept of Pytorch with 1D and 2D tensors, where tensors are defined as vectors that are used as input data to process the deep learning model. Also, derivatives using Pytroch and how to build a Data Set Class and Object, Data Set Transformation and how to compose tranformations are covered in this module. [4 Labs + 4 Quizzes]

### Module1- Tensors - 1D and 2D

In this lab, we will learn the basics of tensor operations. Tensors are an essential part of PyTorch; there are complex mathematical objects in and of themselves. Fortunately, most of the intricacies are not necessary. In this section, you will compare them to vectors and numpy arrays.
