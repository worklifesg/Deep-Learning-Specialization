## General info
This repository is on Deep Learning Specialization using Python 3.8.3 on Visual Studio Code. Most of the programs are from IBM AI Engineering are presenterd only for learning purpose.

## Code setup Information

* The code is writin in Visual Studio code using Python extension with Python 3.8.3 installed on the system. 
* Output results are written in text file (.txt)
* The illustrations are saved as eps and using latex, each documentation is created as .pdf

## Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras

This course focuses on the concept of Deep Learning using the idea of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Along with fundamental concepts, ANN techniques such as Forward Propagation, 
Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, Vanishing Gradient, Activation Functions are explained in this course. There are 5 modules in this course.

* Module 1 - Introduction to Deep Learning
* Module 2 - Artificial Neural Networks
* Module 3 - Deep Learning Libraries
* Module 4 - Deep Learning Models
* Module 5 - Course Assignment
