## Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow

This course focuses on the general machine learning and deep learning algorithms using TensorFlow. It consists of general mathematical concepts, supervised learning like Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and unsupervised learning concepts like Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Autoencoders.

Applications of above concepts are:
```
   Object Recognition - CNN
   Handwritten Notes - CNN
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Sequential data and RNN
   Pattern Detection - RBMs
   Movie Recommendation System - Autoencoder
```
